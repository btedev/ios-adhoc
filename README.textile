h1. AdHoc distribution of iOS apps OTA

This small rack app using "jQTouch":http://.jqtouch.com/ that makes it easy to distribute AdHoc builds of iOS apps over the air. This requires the client to be running OS 4.x

h2. Setup

Place the following files in /public/files

* AdHoc.mobileprovision
* AdHoc.plist
* YourApp.ipa


h2. Running

Everything is just static HTML so you can simply place is on any web server. I have included a rackup file which means you can just put them app to "Heroku":http://heroku.com/ and it works
